Sustainability Insights Suggestions: 
1. The data indicates low passenger activity at Sunbury station for early morning Metro services on a normal weekday, suggesting an opportunity to optimize train schedules and reduce energy consumption by running fewer trains during these low-demand periods.
2. Implementing demand-responsive scheduling and potentially smaller, more energy-efficient trains or carriages during off-peak hours can reduce operational costs and carbon footprint.
3. Encouraging public transportation usage through targeted campaigns or incentives during these times may help balance train loads and improve the overall sustainability of the service.
