Public Utilisation Insights Suggestions: 
1. The anomalously high peopleCount of 500 on 2023-09-26 at 01:00:00 suggests a possible error or unusual event that should be investigated for data accuracy.
2. The consistent battery levels around 3.62 to 3.64 volts indicate stable device performance, but regular monitoring is recommended to ensure uninterrupted data collection.
3. The nonNegPeopleCount often matching the peopleCount except for specific instances like 2023-09-27 and 2023-10-05 suggests that some readings may require validation to ensure accurate visitor tracking at Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve.
