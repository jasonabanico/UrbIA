Safety Insights Suggestions: 
1. Improve road lighting in rural and high-speed zones, especially at known accident hotspots, to enhance visibility and reduce the risk of collisions with fixed objects.
2. Implement additional safety measures such as guardrails and better signage to prevent vehicles from running off the road, particularly in dark, undivided arterial roads.
3. Conduct targeted awareness campaigns and driver education programs focusing on the dangers of driving at high speeds on rural roads, especially for young drivers who are statistically more likely to be involved in such incidents.
